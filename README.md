# Generate_Trace_GIF
A GUI for creating GIFs that trace along user input data

# To run the included python file, the following packages are required (links to anaconda):
* pandas
* glob
* numpy (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy)
* os (https://anaconda.org/jmcmurray/os)
* pathlib (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pathlib)
* tqdm
* PIL
* sys
* matplotlib (https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib)
* PyQt5

# Data-file constraints:
	
A brief description of the subfunction which loads the data is as follows:
1.	Opens the selected file.
2.	Searches the file for a “[Data]” keyword.
3.	Reads the file start from the line after the one containing “[Data]”. Reading is done assuming comma-delimited text.
4.	The first line after the one containing “[Data]” is set to be the header.
5.	The remaining lines are saved as a data frame.

The python program can therefore load any data file that is formatted in the following way:
- Line X: [Data]
- Line X+1: Comma-delimited names of data columns.
- Line X+2 → end of file: Comma-delimited data in string format.

Note: Any lines before Line X do not matter. Can contain any information in any format. The python code will automatically skip them.
	
Second Note: files generated by MultiVu are saved in the appropriate format. If your file is in a different format, you’ll need to convert it using a third-party program.
